## RNA-seq
1. raw count from feature counts
2. raw count filtering with 2/3 method
3. initial DESeq for PCA
4. outlier removal from raw count set if present
5. fpkm calculation
6. fpkm threshold setup
7. fpkm threshold filtering
8. DEG by DESeq
9. DEG filtering by log2FC > 1 & FDR < 0.05
10. DEG filtering if either condition fpkm over threshold  
11. DEGs confirmation by known markers
   11.1. Volcanoplot
   11.2. etc
12. make reports for this
